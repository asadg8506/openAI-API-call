# OpenAI API Call Example (First-Time API Integration)

This project demonstrates how to **make your first API call** to OpenAI using Python. It showcases how to securely handle **API keys** and interact with **GPT-4** to generate responses based on user input.

## 📝 Project Overview

In this project, we:
- Set up **OpenAI API** integration using Python.
- **Securely manage API keys** with the help of the `dotenv` library and environment variables.
- Use the **GPT-4** model to generate responses to a sample user query.

## 📦 Requirements

Before running the code, make sure you have the following:
- **Python 3.x** installed on your system.
- The **OpenAI** Python library for interacting with the OpenAI API.
- The **dotenv** library to manage environment variables.

To install the required dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install openai python-dotenv


🔒 Security Tips
Never expose your API key: Always use environment variables to store sensitive keys.

Do not upload .env files to public repositories. Always include .env in .gitignore.
